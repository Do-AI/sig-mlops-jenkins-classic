    "From a high-level point of view, the pipeline configuration will be responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a **replicable** test and build environment.\n",
    "- Run the unit and integration tests (if applicable).\n",
    "- Promote the application into our staging and production environments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We can see a `Jenkinsfile` below taken from the [`news_classifier`](./models/news_classifier) example.\n",
